During the install process , files are extracted into the install prefix , except for files in the info/ directory . Installing the files of a conda package into an environment can be thought of as changing the directory to an environment , and then downloading and extracting the .zip file and its dependencies—all with the single conda install [ packagename ] command . 1.3 Getting Started With Conda Conda is a powerful package manager and environment manager that you use with command line commands at the Anaconda Prompt for Windows , or in a Terminal window for macOS or Linux . This 20-minute guide to getting started with conda lets you try out the major features of conda . You should understand how conda works when you finish this guide . SEE ALSO : Getting started with Anaconda Navigator , a graphical user interface that lets you use conda in a weblike interface without having to enter manual commands . Compare the Getting started guides for each to see which program you prefer . 1.3.1 Before You Start You should have already installed Anaconda . 1.3.2 Contents Starting conda on Windows , macOS or Linux . 2 MINUTES Managing conda . Verify that Anaconda is installed and check that conda is updated to the current version . 3 MINUTES Managing environments . Create environments and move easily between them . 5 MINUTES - Managing Python . Create an environment that has a different version of Python . 5 MINUTES Managing packages . Find packages available for you to install . Install packages .\n"
