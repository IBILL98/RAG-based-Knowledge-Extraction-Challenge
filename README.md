# RAG Challenge Solution

## Overview

This repository contains the solution for the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) challenge. The goal of this challenge was to implement a RAG system that efficiently retrieves relevant information and uses it to generate accurate and contextually appropriate responses.

## Architecture

The solution is based on the following architecture:

1. **Document Store**: The data should be available in the same directory as the script in files folder.
2. **Retriever**: A component that retrieves relevant documents from the document store based on the input query. This was implemented using FAISS.
3. **Generator**: A model that generates responses based on the retrieved documents. We used llama3.
4. **Pipeline**: The integration of the retriever and generator to form the complete RAG system.

## Installation and Usage

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/rag-challenge-solution.git
    cd rag-challenge-solution
    ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## RAG Implementation

Our RAG implementation is designed to efficiently retrieve and generate responses as follows:

1. **Retrieval**: The retriever fetches top-k relevant documents from the document store using Faiss for indexing and bert-base-multilingual-cased for encoding.
2. **Generation**: The generator processes the retrieved documents and the input query to produce a coherent and contextually appropriate response.

This approach ensures that the generated answers are both relevant and informative, leveraging the rich information stored in the document store.

## Assumptions

- The retriever and generator models are pre-trained and fine-tuned for the specific task.
- The system will handle English language queries and documents.

## Future Improvements

- **Scalability**: Implementing distributed document storage and retrieval to handle larger datasets.
- **Performance**: Optimizing the retriever and generator models for faster response times.
- **User Interface**: Developing a web-based interface for easier interaction with the system.
- **Multilingual Support**: Extending the system to handle multiple languages.

## Unique Features

- **Hybrid Retrieval**: Combining multiple retrieval methods (e.g., sparse and dense) to improve accuracy.
- **Adaptive Generation**: Using context-aware generation techniques to enhance response relevance.
